# eco-grow
This project presents an automated greenhouse control system powered by the PIC16F877A microcontroller. The system integrates real-time soil moisture sensing, temperature-driven ventilation, and ultrasonic-based water level monitoring. It automates critical greenhouse functions such as watering, temperature control, and water management, significantly reducing manual labor and improving plant growth consistency. Testing confirmed accurate sensor responses and reliable actuator operations, highlighting the system's efficiency and potential scalability. This work demonstrates a practical step forward in sustainable agricultural technology, benefiting farming efficiency and crop yield.
